freebsd-update-probe.sh || freebsd-update fetch [install]
  or you could
freebsd-update-probe.sh || mail_sysadmin_to_manually_update
* if /usr/sbin/freebsd-update exit code !=0 be sure to run that manually
  until does exit 0 because the tag assessed by freebsd-update-probe.sh
  is produced by /usr/sbin/freebsd-update
* untested inside FreeBSD Jail environments
* Written/tested on FreeBSD 13.0 (12.2 reported working)
